# Asphalt9A
Asphalt 9 configurable bot based on auto.js

The basic principles of work are the same as <a href="https://github.com/yaldabaoth444/Asphalt9W">here</a>  

**Differences:**  
```javascript
var keys = {nitro: { x: 2138, y: 921 },...}
```
__The path to files is set inside the script__  
```javascript
var rootFolder = '/sdcard/Bot/HUNT/';  
var currentFolder = 'START';
```
